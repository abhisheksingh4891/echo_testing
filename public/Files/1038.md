#### Notes
- If Table 1 (Pending Packets) is empty, no packets have been assigned for evaluation.
- Packets in Table 2 (Done Packets) are locked and cannot be modified.
- Once Secrecy receives locked packets, they will no longer be visible.

#### How to use:
* The Evaluate Papers module allows staff to view, evaluate, and lock exam packets assigned to them, with two tables one for **List of packets ready for evaluation** (Packets that require evaluation) and **List of packets locked post-evaluation** (Packets that have been evaluated and locked).

##### List of packets ready for evaluation

* Locking a Packet
   * Once you have updated marks, click on the Lock button.
   * Confirm the action in the popup.
   * The packet moves to the **Done Packets** section.
